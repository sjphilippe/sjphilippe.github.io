In this report, I will be exploring data from the [Hass Avocado Board]( https://hassavocadoboard.com/) and the [Kaggle Avocado Price (2020)]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/timmate/avocado-prices-2020) data set. The focus will be to compare prices of avocados in Tampa vs Miami Florida. 



|Volume Data Projections| Avocado Prices

## Data Cleaning
-Combined the most recent (2021) price data from Hass to the Kaggle database using EXCEL
-Combined Volume Data Projects from 2019- 2022 into one table using EXCEL
-Corrected capitalization in the ‘type’ column to reflect the Kaggle dataset
-Filtered and removed all regions except Tampa, Miami and TotalUs

While cleaning, I noticed several issues with the datasets. For instance, small, large and xlarge bag size values were missing from 2018-2020. Historical volume import data was limited to 2019 and beyond, while price data stretched back to 2015.  The import volume data for 2022 is constantly updating, while the price data for the first quarter of 2022 is not available for comparison at this time. These discrepancies led me to focus solely on price.
