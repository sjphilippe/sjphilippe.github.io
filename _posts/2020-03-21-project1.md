The Metro Bike Share system has available bikes across Los Angeles area, inclucing Downtown LA, Central LA, Hollywood, North Hollywood and the Westside. Metro Bike Share offers its riders several pass types options and bike choices to meet their daily or spontaneous needs. 

This project uses rides data between ***October 1, 2021 - December 31, 2021***, capturing approximately:
- 62,624 trips
- 30,933 riders
- 217 active bike stations
- 1309 bikes(electric, standard and smart)

# Overview
I structured my analysis to view the data from 3 perspectives: user data, station data, and bike data

User Questions:
1. *How many active users were their between October- December?*
2. *What is the ratio of rider pass type?*
3. *What is the average duration of trips per rider pass type?*

Station Questions:
1. *How many active stations are in each region?*
2. *What are the 10 top most popular stations?*

Bike Questions:  
1. *How many of each bike type are currently in rotation?*
2. *How many trips were taken by each type of type?*
3. *What was the number of trips taken by the most ridden bike?  How long was it used for?*
4. *Which stations did the most popular bikes frequently dock at?* 

### User Analysis 

LA Metro Bike Share categorizes its riders via passes. There are four distinct pass types: 
- Walk -Ups: 1 ride access
- One-day Pass: 24 hour access
- Monthly Pass: 30 day access
- Annual Pass: 365 day access

Between October â€“ December of 2021, monthly riders dominated bike usage with a total of 30,993 riders, followed by walkups, annual pass and one day passes. One day pass riders accounted for the greatest duration of bike usage with an average ride time of 75 min for one-way trips and 112 minutes for round trips.

A notable increase in riders was seen on October 10, 2021 which correlated with the CICLAVIA Heart of LA event. This event closed several miles of street in the center of LA to allow for prestration traffic on roadways. The jump in riders was most noticable in walkup passes and one day passes. Walkup passes increased by 344 rides(112% increase) and one day pass increased by 312(300% increase) compared to the previous day.
