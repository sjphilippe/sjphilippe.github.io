This project analyzes data from the Los Angeles Metro Bike Share Program between October 1, 2021 – December 31, 2021. This is a public data source. I do not own this data.
Data Link: https://bikeshare.metro.net/
Tables:
-	metro_stations • Rows: 348 • Columns: 5
-	metro_trips 2021 Q4 (October-December) • Rows: 62647 • Columns: 15

I structured my analysis to view the data from 3 perspectives: user data, station data, bike data. 

User Analysis 
LA Metro Bike Share categorizes its riders via passes. There are four distinct pass types:
Walk -Ups:1 ride access
One-day Pass: 24 hour access  
Monthly Pass: 30 day access
