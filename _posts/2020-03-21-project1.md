In this article, I will be exploring the data from the Metro Bike Share system in Los Angelos. From this page I downloaded the trip data from 2021 Q4 (October -December) and bike station information from Station Table. The data contained the following fields: 


|Trip Data| | Station Data|
|---------|-|-------------|
|trip_id| end_station |station_id|
|duration|end_lat |station_name|
|start_time| end_lon|go_live_date|
|end_time| bike_id|region |
|start_station|plan_duration |status|
|start_lat|trip_route_category |
|start_lon|passholder_type |
|bike_type|

## Data Cleaning
Before digging in, I always spend some time understanding how the data is layed out and look out for any duplicate or irrelevant data. I cleaned and filtered the data using EXCEL before importing it into PostgreSQL. I made the following changes in EXCEL:
- Removed plan_duration column from the data as passholder_type provided the same information
- Filtered for and removed all stations with the status 'inactive' to save space when uploading data to tableau for visualization. 

This left me with the following summary values:

- 62,624 trips
- 217 active bike stations
- 1309 unique bikes

## Stakeholder Questions
I structured my analysis to describe the data from 3 perspectives that bike share stakeholders would be interested in: user data, station data, and bike data. Visualizations were created using Tableau. 

User Questions:
1. *How many active users were their between October- December?*
2. *What is the ratio of rider pass type?*
3. *What is the average duration of trips per rider pass type?*

Station Questions:
1. *How many active stations are in each region?*
2. *What are the 10 top most popular stations?*

Bike Questions:  
1. *How many of each bike type are currently in rotation?*
2. *How many trips were taken by each type of type?*
3. *What was the number of trips taken by the most ridden bike?  How long was it used for?*
4. *Which station did the most popular bike frequently dock at?* 

## User Analysis 
For user analysis I wanted understand how different rider passes used the Metro service. This included: ratios of pass type, the average durations bikes were used for and how bike usage flucuated over time. 



LA Metro Bike Share categorizes its riders via passes. There are four distinct pass types: 
- Walk-Ups (single ride access)
- One-day Pass
- Monthly Pass
- Annual Pass

At the time this data was pulled, Metro Bike Share hosted a total of 62,644 riders. Monthly riders dominated bike usage with a total of 30,993 riders, followed by walkups, annual pass and one day passes. One day pass riders accounted for the greatest duration of bike usage with an average ride time of 75 min for one-way trips and 112 minutes for round trips.

A notable increase in riders was seen on October 10, 2021 which correlated with the CICLAVIA Heart of LA event. This event closed several miles of street in the center of LA to allow for prestration traffic on roadways. The jump in riders was most noticable in walkup passes and one day passes. Walkup passes increased by 344 rides (112% increase) and one day pass increased by 312 (300% increase) compared to the previous day.

## Station Analysis 

For this anaylsis I foscused on station popularity. Station popularity was determined by how many riders *ended* their rides at a partirulation location. To do this I joined both the metro trips and staton tables. I excluded virtual stations from the query to better compare physical locations only. 


There are 217 active stations spannning 3 regions in the Los Angelos area: <br/>
139 in Down Town Los Angelos (DTLA) <br/>
23 in North Hollywood <br/>
55 in Westside <br/>

Out of these 217 stations, the 3 most popular stations were: <br/>
1. Downtown Santa Monica E Line station in the Westside region with 2832 
2. Ocean Front Walk in the Westside region with 2306.
3. 7th and Flower in the DTLA region with 2090 trips 

The below images shows the the density of trips to each station in their respected region. The larger and darker stations had the most riders

## Bike Analysis 
For bike analysis, I focused on freqeuncy of use. This included which bike type was used the most and which bike had the most trips? I also went one step further to see which station the most popular bike visited. 

I also went one step further to see which station the most popular bike visited. 


There are 1309 bikes in rotation: 
- 1215 standard
- 71 electric
- 23 smart


Although standard bikes account for the **majority of trips** taken (49,654 of 62647 trips), electric bikes are by far the most *favored* bike type. The **top 20 most popular** bikes are all listed as electric, averaging over 100+ rides.

Bike 1309 was the most used bike, with 343 trips total. For comparison, the most popular standard bike was used for 149, and the most popular smart bike was used just 9 times.
Bike 1309's frequented end station was 7th and Flower in the DTLA region for a total of 32 trips.

## Conclusion

This is my first analytic project and I truely enjoyed the challenege of extracting meaningful information from the dataset.  I plan to revisit this project in the furture as a comparison to showcase my increased knowledge in visualizations, analysis and SQL. Some things I would like to add:

- Proximity of stations to popular resturants (like boba tea) or destinations (beaches, parks...)
- Analysis of bike usage around major holidays or events 
- Changes in station usage from inital activation. 
- More complex SQL queries to demonstrate better maniuplation of data
- Grouped visulzations to effectively illustrate trends for stakeholders
- The story of one bikes travels
