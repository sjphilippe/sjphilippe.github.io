I've always liked writing science reports as an undergraduate. Specifically, the results and description section of the paper. 

Creating graphical representations of raw data and teasing out its implications to create a story was and still is my favorite. 

In every industry Iâ€™ve worked in from tech, healthcare, sales and education, data has challenged me to think critically about my environments and the information I observe. 

Asking, what does it mean, why is it this way, who will this impact, where can I implement changes, and when will this occur?

Data is in constant flux, and my diverse industry experience provides a fresh perspective to company norms. 

In my free time I enjoy training my two cats, gardening and traveling to new boba tea shops.
